                   <p>LAPTOP USE:Laptop or notebook computers are increasingly powerful, portable alternatives to smart phones and
                    desktop computers for getting serious work done on the go. If you're moving up to your first laptop
                    or just sitting down at an unfamiliar one, things might seem a little odd at first</p>

                <p>A laptop is a personal computer that is small enough to sit in a person's
                    lap, and is designed for mobile uses. Also called notebooks, laptops are
                    smaller, thinner and lighter than most desktop PC and as of 2011, many
                    laptops included powerful capabilities that rivaled desktops. Desktop PCs
                    generally still provided more computing power – faster processors and more
                    memory – than similarly priced laptops, though the gap was shrinking.
                    Laptops come in many sizes and are designed for numerous uses.</p>

                <p style="background-color: saddlebrown;">Unlike desktop PCs which have several major components connected together with many wires --
                    including a mouse, keyboard and monitor -- a laptop has a built-in keyboard, display and pointer,
                    which offers the advantage of being easily portable. Laptop users can also connect a mouse, separate
                    keyboard, and second monitor to a laptop if they would like. Laptops fold shut when turned off for
                    easy carrying, and most weigh less than 6 lbs. Typically, a laptop includes a battery of lithium-ion
                    or other technology that allows the laptop to run at full power on battery alone for several hours.
                    This allows laptop users to use their computers on a train, in a coffee shop, or even outdoors.
                    Virtually all modern laptops have built in wireless connectivity.

                        <p>A major downgrade for laptops among many users is the fact that there is limited opportunity
                            to upgrade key components. Some laptops have a central processing unit that is soldered into
                            the motherboard and are not replaceable. Many laptops allow the user to upgrade the amount
                            of random access memory by accessing a compartment storing memory modules.
